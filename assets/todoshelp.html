    <td colspan="3"><p>Photo Vault is a very unique app as it allows users to Hide Photos that you don't want others to see from your standard Gallery application. It's unique because it is also a fully functioning ToDo List that as a bonus, also has a fully functioning &quot;Hidden&quot; ToDo list.</p>
      <p>If someone does get a hold of your phone and accidentally finds the Hidden area, you can simply tell them that it is a Hidden ToDo list and show them by entering your Hidden ToDo PIN, all the while they have no idea that it is really hiding a &quot;Hidden&quot; Gallery.</p>
    <p>Another indispensable feature is the &quot;Quick Escape&quot;. If you are looking at your Hidden Gallery and someone approaches and you need to get out fast and you do not want to make it obvious by shaking your phone, simply click the Volume rocker to quickly change the image to either the Default Quick Escape image or one of your choosing.</p></td>
